 Flats Mini-game (flatsMG) by CoreLogic 2015
 ===========================================--
  A simple game of shooting tires for $$. 
   	$100 each tire
	$1000 all four
	Ped must be alive in car for flat to count
	Cars must be on the same street as player, no sniping
	Car will explode if you shoot out all four tires
	Simple UI to ease game play with single key start/stop
	Sound with score tally and payout
	Wanted level still rises so you should be sneaky in your approach

  This is a work in progress, there is a delay when registering a hit. I am working to resolve this issue and add new features.
  
  I am new to Lua, any suggestions on performance, or code improvements are welcome.

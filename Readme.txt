 Flats Mini-game (flatsMG) by CoreLogic 2015
 ===========================================--
  A simple game of shooting tires for $$. 
   - $100 each tire
   - $1000 all four

  This is a work in progress, there is a delay when registering a hit. I am working to resolve this issue and add new features.
  
  I am new to Lua, any suggestions on performance, or code improvements are welcome. 
 
  This code is free to use and share, but please give credit and good will. (CoreLogic http://www.developer-me.com/forums/member.php?action=profile&uid=29)
